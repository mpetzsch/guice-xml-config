#summary Welcome to the ToDo Page - yeh... pretty obvious

= To Do =
* Think of more things to do!
* Different XML binding frameworks, make it more pluggable, JiBX, JAXB etc
 # Will require decoupling current logic from Castor generated classes
* Get better reporting integrated into maven build, currently only FindBugs
* Build in better validation of XML files to get faster up front errors?  Could just let the good Guice errors indicate problems though.

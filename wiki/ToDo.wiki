#summary Welcome to the ToDo Page - yeh... pretty obvious
#labels Featured

= To Do =
 * Think of more things to do!
 * Different XML binding frameworks, make it more pluggable, JiBX, JAXB etc
   # Will require decoupling current logic from Castor generated classes
 * Get better reporting integrated into maven build, currently only FindBugs
 * Build in better validation of XML files to get faster up front errors?  Could just let the good Guice errors indicate problems though. 
 * Some sort of user documentation, or at least some example code
 * Extend the current XSD to make as much as possible of Guice's binding features available through XML... currently where not supported can be done in Java anyway
